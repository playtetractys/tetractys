## Brainstorming

You start the game on Earth or Mars and each choice gives you different starting advantages. You get 10 propmt categories

1. Overall Strategy (developer role in the AI) (goes into every AI prompt so no extra charge for credits)
1. Military Strategy (uses AI credits)

   - AI chooses whether to attack, retreat, surrender, accept surrender, etc.

1. Human Dimplomacy (uses AI credits)
1. Alien Diplomacy (uses AI credits)
1. Resource gathering strategy (no AI credits)
1. Exploration goals or directions which uses fuel (e.g. in the direction of the center of the galaxy or toward the rim) (no AI credits)
1. Research technology (uses AI credits)
1. Admiral training (uses AI credits)

If you reach the center of the galaxy, you get to create your own galaxy.

Space travel scale system? Probalby in lightyears. The scale will be in fuel or tile count which will make it easy to determine how much fuel you need to spend to get to different solar systems.

Each solar system will have a random number of planets. Of those planets a random number will be inhabitable but always at least one. Even the uninhabitable planets will have resources you can mine. No cost to go between planets in the same star system to make it easy to develop the star system.

STORY MODE UI: The UI will have a strong story mode element where the screen is covered by a combination of images, audio, and text that tell a story. There will also be a timeline for any planet that you're on that you can explore. The sci-fi behind this is universal memory stored in quantum fields that AI is able to read from and write to.

MAP MODE UI: 2D map of the galaxy where you can see all stars but only planets of star systems you've been to. When you visit a star system, all planets and resources (e.g. asteroid belts) are revealed automatically. Use hex tiles to connect the areas of the map together. There can only be one star system per tile. That star system can have multiple stars. All ships in a solar system harvest solar radiation for energy and solar systems with multiple stars provide double the energy. Your fleets lose energy as they move between solar systems and gain energy in solar systems.

PROMPT MODE UI: Paralax with the image of your ship at the top (you can cutomize your image by uploading or generating) and it moves into the background as your console comes up.

INTERACTION MODE UI: When you're watching an AI interaction, it will be a log-like interface where you can watch the AI bots talk to each other and take actions.

BATTLE MODE ACTIONS:

1. attack - AI chooses to attach and which attacks to use
1. retreat
1. surrender
1. accept surrender

RESEARCH SYSTEM PARAMS:

1. Movement speed
1. Attack damage
1. Energy costs

By developing a neural-symbiotic interface called the Gravionaut Node, researchers enabled limited communication and eventual co-piloting with these creatures. The space whales generate localized spacetime distortions through organic graviton manipulation, effectively allowing them (and now partnered vessels) to \"glide\" through folded space without traditional propulsion. In-game, unlocking Gravionaut Symbiosis enables a new class of bio-organic ships that do not consume fuel for interstellar jumps, drastically reducing upkeep costs and opening previously unreachable sectors. It also adds a new affinity mechanic where players must cultivate trust with whale colonies via empathy tech and resource offerings, affecting diplomacy, navigation precision, and long-distance travel cooldowns.",

What happens if you run into another fleet in space? Nothing for now. Maybe later, you can allocate optional credits for interacting with fleets you run into in empty tiles.

You can only interact with other fleets that are in the same solar system as you.

FUTURE PHASE: Allow creative users to create and monetize their own content. Maybe stories or items, or whatevs

If you make it to the center of the galaxy, you gain access to the admin panel for your galaxy so you can create your own game mechanics.

Why does the user need to move their character?

I'm writing a story for a PBBG I'm building. Here's what I have so far:

We found that, for AI to be optimally effective, there needs to be a balance between iteration and limitation. Inspired by the Optimal Stopping algorithm AI developed for itself a system of structuring prompts into 10 categories called the tetractys. AI then iterates over these 10 prompts over the course of 24 hours to create the ideal balance between amount of input, time spent processing, and

## Background Story

What if the AI revolution creates the technology to enable every human on Earth to be able to explore the galaxy, mine it for resources, and terraform planets? So, in the game you control a fleet of AI controlled ships and robots. Instead of controlling every action your army takes, you update your instructions (AI prompts) every day and your AI fleet (which can be spread all across the galaxy) uses those instructions to take actions for you.

Quantum Communication is how you can track your AI's progress accross the galaxy. The AI in your command center can decypher the quantum information in entangled electrons. It shows up as glowing ball of light that pulses.

The AI revolution ripped away much of what we thought it was to be human and at the same time crystalized for what it was to be truly human for all of humanity.

### Exploration Strategy: Revolution in Space travel

In the same way the phone, car, and internet allowed us to connect and travel to more than one physical location on earth, AI has enabled us to connect and travel to far more than one planet in our galaxy. By defining an exploration strategy, your AI can

### Research Strategy

If you want to make new discovries, don't forget to define your research strategy so your AI knows what to do and what to look for while it's connecting you to the galaxy.

## Intro Story

Welcome to the Tetractys.

In 2033, a mysterious tech trillionaire was able to start a space mining company that used AI to harvest, refine, and transport valuable minerals from the asteroid belt. Over the course of 3 decades he flooded the market with gold, silver, and dozens of other rare minerals.

Around 2065 global markets began to crash but industries all over the world boomed. Especially the industries around AI and robotics.

When this trillionaire died, he distributed his fortune evenly to every human on Earth and every human that would be born for 100 years. Nobody knew how much money he had but when the first bank tranfers started, the people of Earth soon realized he had enough money to make money meaningless.

Trust in financial markets evaporated and the value of every currency tanked. At the same time as everyone started buying everything they ever needed or wanted. Prices shot up as the balance between supply and demand disappeared completely.

Over the next decade, the economic situation came to a head as people accumulated more and more stuff. The global society started to realize that all this stuff didn't mean anything. Everyone was getting everything they had ever wanted and because of machine workers, they didn't have anything meaningful to do with their time.

Social justice became a global obsession. This abundance of time and resources evenly distributed to every person, seemed to completely solve all problems of scarcity and competition. This hit humanity with a one-two punch of communism and social justice movements. Creating perfect equality and righting every wrong became a global obsession. But without poverty for the left to fight against and capitalism for the right to defend, many of the problems of society started to simply disappear. This causesd a crisis of identity and purpose all over the world.

As humanity was going through these growing pains, sattelites began to pick up a gigantic fleet of space ships coming toward Earth. As it passed Mars, it began transmitting to the entire world an audio message recorded by Rob Hoster. In it, he finally explained why he did what he did and the purpose of this massive fleet of spaceships.

"Hello Humanity. First I must apologize for the chaos you've endured as a result of my parting gift. I trust by now you have all learned the lesson that should always follow from great wealth. To put it in my own words, money don't mean shit. I'm sure you're all wonderIn 2025, as the AI revolution kicked into high gear, I quickly realized that it presented many opportunities to humanity; some good, some bad, some existential. But after years of research and experimentation, I believe I have discovered an opportunity for humanity to use AI to thrive and grow like never before.

"This fleet of ships called Tetractys was built by automated AI drones. Right now there are 100 individual fleets on their way to Earth and they will be available to applicants
